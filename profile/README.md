For investors seeking passive income, dividends are often a key component of their investment strategy. A common question many investors ask is: Is a dividend of 35.25c good? The answer isn’t straightforward, as the value of a dividend depends on several factors, including the company's financial health, dividend yield, and your investment goals. In this article, we’ll break down what a dividend of 35.25c means and how to evaluate whether it’s good.

What Does a Dividend of 35.25c Mean?

While the absolute value of a dividend might seem small, its significance depends on the following factors:

Number of Shares You Own: The more shares you own, the higher your total dividend payout.

Frequency of Payment: Dividends are often paid quarterly, meaning you could receive 35.25c per share four times a year.

How to Determine If a 35.25c Dividend Is Good

To evaluate whether a 35.25c dividend is good, consider the following key metrics:

Dividend Yield

The dividend yield measures the annual dividend payment as a percentage of the stock’s current price. It’s a useful indicator of how much return you’re getting from dividends relative to your investment.

Formula:

Dividend Yield = (Annual Dividend per Share / Stock Price) x 100

Example:
If the stock price is $50 and the annual dividend is 35.25c x 4 (quarterly payments), the yield is:

($1.41 / $50) x 100 = 2.82%

A dividend yield of 2.82% could be considered good, depending on industry standards and current market conditions.

Payout Ratio

The payout ratio indicates what percentage of a company’s earnings is paid out as dividends. A lower payout ratio suggests the company retains enough earnings for growth, while a very high payout ratio could indicate financial strain.

Formula:

Payout Ratio = (Dividends per Share / Earnings per Share) x 100

Guidelines:

A payout ratio between 30% and 60% is generally considered healthy.

Ratios above 75% may indicate risk, as the company might not have enough earnings to sustain future dividends.

Industry Comparison

Dividend expectations vary by industry. Utility and consumer staple companies often pay higher dividends, while tech companies may pay lower dividends or reinvest profits into growth.

Example:

A 35.25c dividend might be excellent for a tech stock but average for a utility stock.

Advantages of Dividend-Paying Stocks

Steady Income: Dividends provide consistent cash flow, which can be reinvested or used for expenses.

Long-Term Growth: Reinvesting dividends can compound returns over time.

Signal of Financial Health: A consistent dividend often reflects a company’s stability and profitability.

When a 35.25c Dividend Might Not Be Good

While dividends are appealing, a 35.25c dividend might not always indicate a strong investment opportunity. Be cautious in these scenarios:

High Payout Ratio: If the company is paying out most of its earnings as dividends, it may struggle to reinvest in growth.

Unsustainable Dividend: A high yield that exceeds industry norms could signal financial instability.

Stock Price Decline: If the stock’s price has dropped significantly, a seemingly good dividend yield could be misleading.

Conclusion

A dividend of 35.25c can be good, depending on your investment goals and the company’s financial health. By examining metrics like dividend yield, payout ratio, and industry standards, you can determine whether this dividend aligns with your portfolio strategy.
